              Not all of us are fit to work with the same performance during the
              same time of the day. Some of us learn like they’re born to do it
              in the morning while others do the same at noon or after midnight.
              Such a difference completely OK, while it is up to us to find out
              when we learn best.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider this: You learn much better at night and despite long
              study hours during the morning, your short studies during the
              night time easily outperforms the morning ones. In this case, it
              is better to shift your focus to the night time to get the best of
              you. Remember, the point is to get the best of you.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a final remark, let’s put the case into an equation (trust me,
              this will help):
            </p>
            <p><b> X = the duration of your study/learning process </b></p>
            <p><b> Y= the time of the day during which you study </b></p>
            <p>
              If we suppose you learn best during the morning hours (1,5 times
              more than the other times of the day), then 2 hours of study
              during the morning will turn out to be: 2 hrs(X) * 1,5 (learning
              performance) = 3 (learning outcome).
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other side, if you study the same amount during night time
              (which enables your normal learning performance in this given
              case), things will be like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                2 hrs(X) * 1 (learning performance) = 2 (learning outcome).</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              You see the difference? This is important in two ways. Firstly, it
              saves you effort and lets you spend your energy on other things.
              Secondly, it saves you time along with your energy. Go figure it
              out before you commit yourself to work/studies next time and see
              the difference yourself.
